    "SkillFE":"Use Figma to draw the web page structure, use HTML/CSS/Javascript/React/Next. Implement the web tools that be used on the work ,and other side projects.The function of Web Tool is to help Training Data make Labels. It uses the React framework to make web pages and connects with the back-end Web API.In addition, I also implement my own personal web page. Beside my education and work experience, the web page also demo and introduce other side project. It was implemented with React framework,then tested by Jest + Enzyme.Beautification of appearance adopts SCSS+bootstrap ,and with RWD function.Back-end uses Node.js/Express to create routes,database uses MongoDB/Mongoose for data management.",
